# PTZOptics-OBS-named-presets
Built on the existing PTZoptics Dockable OBS controllers, these allow the user to easily rename presets, instead of having crude images that cannot be easily edited or changed. Additionally, there are some bug fixes, and instead of alerts, the notifications for IP address saved and Preset saved are now displayed on the HTML.
